                <p>Here is my current computer build, it was meant to be a cheap $800 build but that changed drastically as Christmas gave me a bunch of free spending money. Also, when I first powered my computer on, I didn't have a GPU in it and instead was using my integrated graphics to run and install my necessary software. Then 4 months later, I got enough money to buy my GPU.</p>

                <p>The purpose of an SSD is to have a storage device that can grab things from the drive super fast. It is only 240gb because it is only supposed to hold essentials that I would need to acces on the go.</p>

                <p>I thought this build would be very cheap and went for a GTX960 2GB by EVGA. I was wrong... Therefor, I upgraded to an MSI GTX960 4GB instead of an MSI GTX970. Why? I wasn't thinking that the I was in reach of a 970 until after I recieved the new 960.</p>

                <p>The Define R5 had already come out but I wanted to buy the R4 because I liked the way it looked on the inside and also it was cheaper. Also, I wasn't going for aesthetics in my computer build since it was going to be on the ground and I only wanted something that would hold the computer. I highly regret buying the case without a window port on it instead of the one that did have one.</p>

                <p>I used to use this a lot until I got an ethernet cable wired to my room. This was very handy for Windows 8, 8.1 and a month for 10. This module was pretty cheap but it worked very well. Unfortunately, it is not working how it should and I have spent the past 10 months trying to figure it out but with nothing working. I am afraid that I have a defective card that I am now unable to replace.</p>

                <p>I bought 2 of these fans and these were a steal. I bought these fans when they were supposed to be $25 but they were only $11.99. I needed 2 fans that would greatly improve the airflow of my computer because the two that I had were silent fans and therefor slower. These ones are louder yes, but the positioning of the fans made them no louder than the silent ones.</p>
