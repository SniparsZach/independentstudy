                <br>
                <p>Here is my current computer build, it was meant to be a cheap $800 build but that changed drastically as Christmas gave me a bunch of free spending money. Also, when I first powered my computer on, I didn't have a GPU in it and instead
                    was using my integrated graphics to run and install my necessary software. Then 4 months later, I got enough money to buy my GPU.</p>

                <p>This CPU Cooler is very slim and enables better clearence for putting in RAM. This one is also widely used by the gaming community and is highly reliable.</p>

                <p>This motherboard is more on the older side, released on June?, 2013, but is cost effective. This motherboad is compatible with my processor and also the RAM that I use.</p>

                <p>This type of RAM is now out of date due to the release of the newer, faster version of RAM, DDR4 but it does the job. Also, DDR4 isn't supported on my motherboard due to it being release a year and a half later (September 2014).</p>

                <p>The purpose of an SSD is to have a storage device that can grab things from the drive super fast. It is only 240gb because it is only supposed to hold essentials that I would need to acces on the go.</p>

                <p>The drive was pretty cheap for the size at the time and I am glad I bought such a big storage device. At the moment, it has games, video recordings, documents, editiing software and much more on that takes up more than half of drive.</p>

                <p>I thought this build would be very cheap and went for a GTX960 2GB by EVGA. I was wrong... Therefor, I upgraded to an MSI GTX960 4GB instead of an MSI GTX970. Why? I wasn't thinking that the I was in reach of a 970 until after I recieved
                    the new 960.</p>

                <p>The Define R5 had already come out but I wanted to buy the R4 because I liked the way it looked on the inside and also it was cheaper. Also, I wasn't going for aesthetics in my computer build since it was going to be on the ground and
                    I only wanted something that would hold the computer. I highly regret buying the case without a window port on it instead of the one that did have one.</p>

                <p>I bought a bronze certified power supply because I was trying to save as much money as I could so I could buy my GPU. This power supply is perfectly fine though and I have used it since January 2015 with no problems at all.</p>

                <p>I only got an Optical Drive just so I could install all the hardware software and my operating system. I tried to get the cheapest one I could find that would be able to do those things and it was this one, priced at a decent $23.99.</p>

                <p>I used to use this a lot until I got an ethernet cable wired to my room. This was very handy for Windows 8, 8.1 and a month for 10. This module was pretty cheap but it worked very well. Unfortunately, it is not working how it should and
                    I have spent the past 10 months trying to figure it out but with nothing working. I am afraid that I have a defective card that I am now unable to replace.</p>
                <p>EDIT: I got the card to work on 9/5/2016 and can now use my computer without the use of an ethernet cord.</p>

                <p>I bought 2 of these fans and these were a steal. I bought these fans when they were supposed to be $25 but they were only $11.99. I needed 2 fans that would greatly improve the airflow of my computer because the two that I had were silent
                    fans and therefor slower. These ones are louder yes, but the positioning of the fans made them no louder than the silent ones.</p>
